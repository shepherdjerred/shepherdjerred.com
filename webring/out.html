    a Pikmin 3 challenge run where they collected 0 fruit to beat the game. I thought I could do better, so I beat it in
    2 hours 24 minutes. Full run without commentary: https://youtu.be/nHFIn74-mLk @TheBacklogs' run:

    One may observe an axis, or a “spectrum”, along which free and open source software licenses can be organized, where
    one end is “permissive” and the other end is “copyleft”. It is important to acknowledge, however, that though
    copyleft can be found at the opposite end of an axis with respect to permissive, it is not synonymous with the
    linguistic antonym of permissive – that is, copyleft licenses are not “restrictive” by comparison with permissive
    licenses. Aside: Free software is not synonymous with copyle…

    The dream of soaring in the sky like a bird has captivated the human mind for ages. Although many failed, some
    eventually succeeded in achieving that goal. These days we take air transportation for granted, but the physics of
    flight can still be puzzling. In this article we’ll investigate what makes airplanes fly by looking at the forces
    generated by the flow of air around the aircraft’s wings. More specifically, we’ll focus on the cross section of
    those wings to reveal the shape of an airfoil – you can see…
