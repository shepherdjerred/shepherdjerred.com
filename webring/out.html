    Author's note Originally, I was gonna wait a bit before writing this. I had intended this to be written and
    published in a few weeks after the NixOS foundation board had time to react and attempt to control the damage from
    whatever the fuck has been going on over there. I just don't care at this point. I need this out of my head and off
    of my chest. I would also like to have made this a video of some kind to make it more personal (mostly so you can
    hear my voice and intonation/emotio…

    One may observe an axis, or a “spectrum”, along which free and open source software licenses can be organized, where
    one end is “permissive” and the other end is “copyleft”. It is important to acknowledge, however, that though
    copyleft can be found at the opposite end of an axis with respect to permissive, it is not synonymous with the
    linguistic antonym of permissive – that is, copyleft licenses are not “restrictive” by comparison with permissive
    licenses. Aside: Free software is not synonymous with copyle…

  </h4>
  <p class="summary" dir="auto">
    In 2017, we looked at how web bloat affects users with slow connections. Even in the U.S., many users didn't have
    broadband speeds, making much of the web difficult to use. It's still the case that many users don't have broadband
    speeds, both inside and outside of the U.S. and that much of the modern web isn't usable for people with slow
    internet, but the exponential increase in bandwidth (Nielsen suggests this is 50% per year for high-end connections)
    has outpaced web bloat for typical sites, making this l…
