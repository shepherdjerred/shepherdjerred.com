    It's been well over a year since I started serving 429s to clients which are hitting the feed too often. Since then,
    much has happened, and most of it is generally good news. I've heard from users and authors alike of feed software.
    Sometimes the users have filed bug reports and/or feature requests and have gotten positive results from the project
    (or vendor). Other times, the authors of such software have gotten in touch, did some digging, found a few nuances
    of how their libraries work, and imp…

    In the hours following the release of CVE-2023-52656 for the project The Linux kernel, site reliability workers and
    systems administrators scrambled to desperately rebuild and patch all their systems to fix a somewhat vague
    "exploitable" vulnerability in io_uring that isn't easily understandable from the given reports, but it involves
    trying to pass io_uring file descriptors over UNIX sockets with SCM_RIGHTS in a way that I can't easily read from
    the changelogs. This is due to the affected component…

    I needed a bit of a break from “real work” recently, so I started a new programming project that was low-stakes and
    purely recreational. On April 21st, I set out to see how much of a Unix-like operating system for x86_64 targets
    that I could put together in about a month. The result is Bunnix. Not including days I didn’t work on Bunnix for one
    reason or another, I spent 27 days on this project. Here’s a little demo of the results… You can try it for yourself
    if you like: Bunnix 0.0.0 iso To boot this ISO…
