I'm a software engineer. I have a particular passion for programming languages, infrastructure, and developer tools. Some of my favorite languages are Rust, Haskell, TypeScript, and Java (strictly for sentimental reasons).

I'm studying at [Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) to pursue a Masters in Computer Science.

I'm a fan of free software and a supporter of open source.

I'm very active on [GitHub](https://github.com/shepherdjerred), so you can check that out if you're curious about what I've been working on. My [resume](https://resume.sjer.red/) has a bit more of a complete view of my background.

My non-computer-related interests include rock climbing, cooking, cats, and reading.
