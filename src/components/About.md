I'm a software engineer. I have a particular passion for programming languages, infrastructure, and developer tools.
Some of my favorite languages are Rust, Haskell, TypeScript, and Java (strictly for sentimental reasons).

I'm studying at [Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) to pursue a Masters in Computer Science (OMSCS).
This semester (Fall 2023) I'm taking [Computer Networks](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6250-computer-networks) and
[Video Game Design](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6457-video-game-design).

I'm a fan of free software and a supporter of open source.

I'm very active on [GitHub](https://github.com/shepherdjerred),
so you can check that out if you're curious about what I've been working on.
My [résumé](https://resume.sjer.red/) has a bit more of a complete view of my background.

My non-computer-related interests include rock climbing, cooking, cats, and reading.
