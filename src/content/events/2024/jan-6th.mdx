[RSVP here](https://strawpoll.com/LVyK8Aw46n0) so that I know how much space we need.

I'll setup my house to have plenty of table space. We can fit ~10-14 desktops.

In the past we've played:

- League of Legends
- COD (MW2, Zombies)

We'll probably order dinner at some point.

## What to bring

- Something to play games on
  - PC/Laptop, monitor, keyboard/mouse, headset, etc.
- Snacks and drinks
