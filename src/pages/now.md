- Reading _[The Murderbot Diaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Murderbot_Diaries)_.
  - I'm on book 3 and I'm really enjoying it.
- Trying to replace running with biking.
- Awaiting hearing back from the donor committee.
- Picking up my UWMC badge this week!
- LeetCode!
- Refinished my outdoor furniture. I got lazy towards the end, but it still looks pretty good.
- Dredging up my [game engine](https://github.com/shepherdjerred/castle-casters). I've fixed a few old bugs an I'm wanting to make the game playable.
- Still not sure what to do with my cilantro and lettuce. Maybe I'll let the cilantro turn into coriander seed?

  Which brings me to...

- Starting to volunteer at UW Montlake.
- Enjoying the start of summer. Lots of gardening, yard/lawn maintenance, re-finishing wooden outdoor furniture, and
  spending more time outside.
