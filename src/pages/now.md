# Now

Inspired by <https://sive.rs/now>

## 2024 09 06

- Reading _[The Murderbot Diaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Murderbot_Diaries)_.
- Finished up my CGM, things are looking good for the kidney donation!
- Working on my UWMC competencies.
- Starting to LeetCode again.
- Nearly done refinishing my outdoor furniture (next up is painting my living room!).
- Lots of gardening. I have way too much cilantro and lettuce.
- Figuring out how I want to apply my technical expertise.
  What's the point of learning so many cool things without doing something with that knowledge?
- Enjoying not having school for the summer.

## Past

- Reading _A Desolation Called Peace_.
- Donating a kidney. It's looking like I can donate, but we're looking into an episode of hypoglycemia first.
  Which brings me to...
- Wearing a continuous glucose monitor for the next two weeks!
- Starting to volunteer at UW Montlake.
- Enjoying the start of summer. Lots of gardening, yard/lawn maintenance, re-finishing wooden outdoor furniture, and
  spending more time outside.
- Taking the summer off from my Master's at Georgia Tech. I needed a break after taking compilers.
- Therapy.
