# Now (05/24/2024)

Inspired by <https://sive.rs/now>

- Donating a kidney. It's looking like I can donate, but we're looking into an episode of hypoglycemia first.
  Which brings me to...
- Wearing a continuous glucose monitor for the next two weeks!
- Starting to volunteer at UW Montlake.
- Enjoying the start of summer. Lots of gardening, yard/lawn maintenance, re-finishing wooden outdoor furniture, and
  spending more time outside.
- Taking the summer off from my Master's at Georgia Tech. I needed a break after taking compilers.
- Therapy.
