I'm currently looking for a job. If you're interested in working with me, send me an email: <contact@sjer.red>.

I'm most interested in roles around the Seattle area. I'm particularly wanting to work somewhere in-office or hybrid.

I'm experienced with both backend and frontend development. I have five years of professional experience.

You can view my résumé [here](https://resume.sjer.red/).

My [GitHub](https://github.com/shepherdjerred/) hosts my many personal projects.
