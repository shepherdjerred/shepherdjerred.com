# Now (05/23/2024)

Inspired by https://sive.rs/now

- Donating a kidney. I just have one more lab test to pass before I'm cleared. I'm hoping to donate in the next month.
- Starting to volunteer at UW Montlake.
- Enjoying the start of summer. Lots of gardening, yard/lawn maintenance, re-finishing wooden outdoor furniture, and spending more time outside.
- Taking the summer off from my Master's at Georgia Tech. I needed a break after taking compilers.
- Therapy.
